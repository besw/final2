        <div class="col-3">
           <p>I have been repairing migrant’s and refugee’s computers for well over 9 years and still service most of the same people today. I have helped many of them  resolve their basic technical problems from 1 computer and no internet, to a full blown network of several house appliances </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p>I am very proud of how my contribution has grown so much over the years and that I able to provide even better quality services today. I really do not advertise at all, I almost totally depend on the mgranst and refugees living in the concentration camps.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="col-3">
        <p>when I give technical support, do it quickly, correctly, efficiently and professionally every time. I could go on and on but just take a minute to look at the growing list of Testimonials from my satisfied friends.. You don't have to go far down the list to see that I must be doing something right and why they trust me after all these years with their technology needs.</p>
